### Track: Build Starknet.anything
Team Members: Pedro Lourenco, Alvin Lam and Alexander Catterall

### Overview:
Here is a chrome extention, that punishes you for not being discplined. You choose what websites you want to avoid, if you visit any of these websites you will donate some of your $STRK to charity. It calculates how long you have spent on the website, and then charges you the time based on 

### Future roadmap of the project:
We envision a new business model on how one visits websites. Picture a scenario where a users wallet is the key to visiting certain websites. 
For example think of streaming a football game, currently the model is monthly subscription, but what if you could pay for the very minutes that you watch the a livestream.
